I've always wanted to learn programming, but i was hesitant because people in tech often say It's difficult and i decided to see  if i can learn, then i  applied for a beginner's programming class on coursera last year but i couldn't learn due to the fear and all.That fear held me back until recently when Adeshina posted the opecstart program on whatsapp . At first i was relunctant, so i decided to try again . With Adeshina's support I didn't know programming can be so sweet and my tech journey has been incredible so far. I hope to maintain this energy until the end of the class.
