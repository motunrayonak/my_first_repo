In the next five months, I want to build a strong foundation in programming,my main focus is on improving my problem solving skills, writting clean code, and understanding how software development works. I also want to work on real projects, contribute to open source, and build a solid portfolio. Connecting with experienced people in tech and staying consistent with learning are also part of my plan.
